        collection into your classroom to support skills and concepts that you are already teaching, or that you may be planning to teach. Thematic chapters introduce students to HMA artworks through grade-appropriate activities that encourage them
        to think critically, to express themselves creatively, and to make connections between their own lives and WATER. Click here for <a href="https://www.marquette.edu/haggerty/educational-educators.php">more information</a>.

Each project is tailored to the specific needs and enthusiasm of the school’s community but often involves replacing seas of asphalt with green spaces including bioswales, rain gardens, and trees. The placemaking designs go beyond simply removing pavement, however, to maximize triple-bottom-line benefits.

The planning effort to support green infrastructure installation near schoolyards itself can involve students, teachers, and community members. In this activity, students conduct a sewershed assessment to document the potential pollution sources within a school’s sewershed, map the boundaries of the sewershed, and gather information to estimate the size of conceptual green infrastructure that may be possible to help manage the stormwater that falls on the site. This information is then integrated with Google Earth to create a map and visual story of the site’s water quality, quantity and opportunity to manage stormwater more effectively.",,"Curriculum",,"Watersheds, Stormwater & Green Infrastructure"
